# Ninja Posts

[React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) works like some sort of *middleware* that makes React Native components compatible to the React DOM. I chose this one over traditional React because it's more intuitive to me, considering I had very limited time to build this. That said, *Ninja Posts* is a "React Native Web" application.

## How to run it

- Clone this repository.
- Open a terminal in the project folder and run `yarn` so the dependencies will be installed.
- After the previous step is done, run `yarn start` and a browser should automatically open the app.
